    <td>Conjunctive adverbs are words that join independent clauses into one sentence. A conjunctive adverb helps you create a shorter sentence.<br><br>When you use a conjunctive adverb, put a semicolon (;) before it and a comma (,) after it. <br><br><ul><li>We have many different sizes of this shirt; <u>however</u>, it comes in only one color.</li></ul>Some examples of conjunctive adverbs are: <i>accordingly, also, besides, consequently, finally, however, indeed, instead, likewise, meanwhile, moreover, nevertheless, next, otherwise, still, therefore, then</i>, etc. <br><br><ul><li>The due date for the final paper has passed; <u>therefore</u>, I could not submit mine on time.</li><li>There are many history books; <u>however</u>, none of them may be accurate.</li><li>It rained hard; <u>moreover</u>, lightening flashed and thunder boomed.</li><li>The baby fell asleep; <u>then</u>, the doorbell rang.</li><li>The law does not permit drinking and driving anytime; <u>otherwise</u>, there would be many more accidents.</li></ul>Conjunctive adverbs look like coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor); however, they are not as strong as coordinating conjunctions and they are punctuated differently.<br><br>A conjunctive adverb is also used in a single main clause. In this case, a comma (,) is used to separate the conjunctive adverb from the sentence. <br><br><ul><li>I woke up very late this morning. <u>Nevertheless</u>, I wasn’t late to school.</li><li>She didn’t take a bus to work today.  <u>Instead</u>, she drove her car.</li><li>Jack wants a toy car for his birthday. <u>Meanwhile</u>, Jill wants a dollhouse for her birthday.</li><li>They returned home. <u>Likewise</u>, I went home.</li></ul><br><b><font size="3">[Activity 1]</font></b><br><br>Choose the right conjunctive adverb for the sentence.<br><br>1)Hurry up; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, you will be late for the train. <br>2)I studied hard for the exam; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, I failed. <br>3)Tom is a sportsman; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, his brother Tom is athletic. <br>4)He didn’t go to college.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he started his own business. <br>5)He is not good-looking.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he is popular among girls.</td>
