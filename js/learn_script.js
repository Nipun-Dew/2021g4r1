    `<h2>Big Picture</h2>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content 
    of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a 
    more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content 
    here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
    editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' 
    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
     years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>`,

     `<h2>Intro</h2>
     <p>ontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece 
     of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
     a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
     words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
     literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
     "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book 
     is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
     "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>`,

     `<h2>Tenses</h2>
     <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration 
     in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are 
     going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle 
     of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this 
     the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful 
     of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore 
     always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>`,

     `<h2>Synonyms</h2>
     <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
     dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
     It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
     It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
     desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>`,

    `<h2>Conjunctive Adverbs</h2>
    <p>
    <td>Conjunctive adverbs are words that join independent clauses into one sentence. A conjunctive adverb helps you create a shorter sentence.<br><br>When you use a conjunctive adverb, put a semicolon (;) before it and a comma (,) after it. <br><br><ul><li>We have many different sizes of this shirt; <u>however</u>, it comes in only one color.</li></ul>Some examples of conjunctive adverbs are: <i>accordingly, also, besides, consequently, finally, however, indeed, instead, likewise, meanwhile, moreover, nevertheless, next, otherwise, still, therefore, then</i>, etc. <br><br><ul><li>The due date for the final paper has passed; <u>therefore</u>, I could not submit mine on time.</li><li>There are many history books; <u>however</u>, none of them may be accurate.</li><li>It rained hard; <u>moreover</u>, lightening flashed and thunder boomed.</li><li>The baby fell asleep; <u>then</u>, the doorbell rang.</li><li>The law does not permit drinking and driving anytime; <u>otherwise</u>, there would be many more accidents.</li></ul>Conjunctive adverbs look like coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor); however, they are not as strong as coordinating conjunctions and they are punctuated differently.<br><br>A conjunctive adverb is also used in a single main clause. In this case, a comma (,) is used to separate the conjunctive adverb from the sentence. <br><br><ul><li>I woke up very late this morning. <u>Nevertheless</u>, I wasnâ€™t late to school.</li><li>She didnâ€™t take a bus to work today.  <u>Instead</u>, she drove her car.</li><li>Jack wants a toy car for his birthday. <u>Meanwhile</u>, Jill wants a dollhouse for her birthday.</li><li>They returned home. <u>Likewise</u>, I went home.</li></ul><br><b><font size="3">[Activity 1]</font></b><br><br>Choose the right conjunctive adverb for the sentence.<br><br>1)Hurry up; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, you will be late for the train. <br>2)I studied hard for the exam; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, I failed. <br>3)Tom is a sportsman; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, his brother Tom is athletic. <br>4)He didnâ€™t go to college.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he started his own business. <br>5)He is not good-looking.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he is popular among girls.</td>
